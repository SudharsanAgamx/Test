# Agent Lifecycle & Extensibility

Understanding the agent lifecycle is key to building robust and extensible automations in AgamX.

## Agent Lifecycle Stages
1. **Registration:** Agent is registered with the agent registry (`agent_registry.py`).
2. **Initialization:** Agent is instantiated and configured for its task.
3. **Execution:** Agent performs its assigned task (e.g., database operation, email processing).
4. **Coordination:** Orchestrator manages agent interactions and workflow state.
5. **Termination:** Agent completes its task and is cleaned up or re-used.

## Extensibility
- Implement new agent types by following the interface patterns in the codebase
- Register new agents for orchestration and discovery
- Extend agent methods for custom logic and integrations

## Best Practices
- Keep agents modular and focused on single responsibilities
- Use the registry for discoverability and permission management
- Document agent APIs and extension points for maintainability
