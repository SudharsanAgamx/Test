# Workflow Design

This page explains how to design effective workflows using agents and tools in AgamX.

## Principles
- Break down automation into modular tasks
- Use the orchestrator to coordinate agents
- Leverage tools for specialized operations

## Example Workflow
1. Email agent reads new emails
2. Database agent stores extracted data
3. Orchestrator manages the sequence and error handling

## Tips
- Use configuration files for workflow parameters
- Test workflows with sample data before production
