Welcome to the AgamX Enterprise AI Automation Platform documentation!

## Platform Overview & Value Proposition

AgamX is a multi-agent automation platform built on top of LangChain, LangSmith, and MCP, designed to orchestrate intelligent agents for enterprise workflows. The platform integrates robust evaluation and testing (using pytest and custom evaluators), and provides extensible automation for business processes.

### What You'll Learn
- The core concepts of AgamX (agents, orchestration, tools)
- How to set up your environment for development and testing
- How to create your first automation using the provided agent and tool modules
- How to evaluate and test your automations using the built-in evaluation suite
- Key resources and code locations for further exploration (see `langchain-mcp/agent`, `langchain-mcp/tools`, `langchain-mcp/evls`, `langchain-mcp/pytest`)
