# Scalability & Performance

AgamX is designed for scalability and high performance in enterprise environments.

## Horizontal Scaling
- Agents are modular and can be run in parallel to handle increased workloads.
- Orchestrator can distribute tasks across multiple agent instances.

## Performance Optimization
- Use asynchronous processing where possible (e.g., email and database operations).
- Tools are designed for reuse and efficiency.
- Evaluation and testing can be parallelized (see `/pytest/`).

## Extensibility
- New agents and tools can be added without modifying the core orchestrator logic.
- Integration points allow for easy connection to new external systems.

## Monitoring
- Use logging and metrics (see `/evls/` and `/pytest/` for test and evaluation reporting) to monitor system health and performance.
