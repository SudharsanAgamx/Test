# Security Model

Security is a core consideration in AgamX's architecture.

## Authentication
- Agents and tools authenticate with external systems (O365, databases) using secure credentials.
- See `auth.py` in `/tools/` for authentication helpers and environment setup.

## Access Control
- Agent registry manages which agents are available and their permissions.
- Sensitive operations (e.g., database writes, email sending) are restricted to authorized agents.

## Data Protection
- Data in transit between agents is handled in-memory and not persisted unless required.
- External integrations use secure protocols (e.g., OAuth for O365).

## Best Practices
- Store credentials in environment variables or secure vaults.
- Regularly review agent and tool permissions.
- Use logging and monitoring to detect unauthorized access.
